ARTE Teasers
============

This module and it's sub-modules goal is to display some "teasers" content anywhere.
A teaser can be mostly used to display a block linking to a real content, but it may also
be used to display a facebook widget, or some twitter one...

Used for now on ASF and Cinema, but may be extended soon to other platforms.

## Features

- Display mode per node via Display Suite.
- Disable full node page.
- Other useful teaser options.

## TODOs

- Port the module to all platforms needing teasers.
- Improve the code, allow to customize things easily per platform.
- Couple to the Info ARTE Grid module to have same display method on all platforms maybe.

And more...
